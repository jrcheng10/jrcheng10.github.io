### Prior Experience

Before coming to the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, I worked as a financial analyst at the New York City Council â€“ Finance Division, providing fiscal and policy oversight for New York City Health + Hospitals and the Test and Trace Corps during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. I began my career with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), where I served for four years as a research analyst supporting union organizing, collective bargaining, and policy advocacy on behalf of healthcare workers across the acute care and long-term care sectors in the United States.

### Prior Education

I studied politics at a liberal arts college in the Midwest, with a focus on international and comparative political economy.

### Skills

I work primarily in R/RStudio, but have some prior experience with Python and SQL. This site was created in R Markdown.

### Miscellaneous

I have lived on and off in New York City for about eight years now, and am currently based in Washington Heights.
